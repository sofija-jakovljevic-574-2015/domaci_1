to me 
Dear SOFIJA JAKOVLJEVIC:
Thank you for licensing your Xilinx® design tool or IP core product. This email includes the certificate license file to enable your product.
The license file can also be obtained by returning to the Xilinx Product Licensing Site: 
http://www.xilinx.com/getlicense
For complete instructions on installing this license file, see the  Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Release Notes, Installation, and Licensing  document on the Xilinx web at:          
http://www.xilinx.com/cgi-bin/docs/rdoc?v=latest;d=iil.pdf;a=ObtainManageLicense
Quick-Start License Installation Instructions
Node-locked Licenses:
These steps will copy your license file to the appropriate default directory (the .Xilinx directory under your home drive – typically C: for Windows).
1.     Save the attached license file (.lic) to your desktop or some other folder on your computer
2.     Run the Vivado License Manager
Windows:  Run ‘Manage Xilinx Licenses’ from underneath your Version group of the Xilinx Design Tools program group
Linux:  Type ‘vlm’ in a command-line window
3.     Select the ‘Load License’ screen and click on the ‘Copy License…’ button
4.     Browse to the downloaded license file and click ‘Open’ 
Note:  IP licenses generated from the Xilinx Product Licensing Site are designed to be used with IP released against Vivado Design Suite (all versions) and 11.2 and later versions of ISE Design Suite IP.  If this is an IP license to be used with a 10.1 or earlier ISE Design Suite design tool installation, the license file should be copied to .Xilinx\Coregen\CoreLicenses instead of C:\.Xilinx.
Floating Licenses:
If you have an existing FLEXnet floating license server, it may be easiest to simply copy the license keys in the attached file into the license file you are already using with your license server.
Note:  Please restart your floating license server to allow the changes to take effect.
If you are setting up a FLEXnet floating license server for the first time, please see the Vivado Design Suite User Guide: Release Notes, Installation, and Licensing document for more detailed directions.
